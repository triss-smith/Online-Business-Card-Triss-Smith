        <div>
          <p>  I have always been passionate about all things technology. At 5 years old, I was taking apart my N64 to see what it looked like. After
          high school, I attended the University of Louisiana at Monroe to study Computer Science. Having taken dual enrollment courses, I was able to start on major requirements
          immediately. <br><br>  Initially, programming intimidated me, purely because of the high ceiling. Soon I was programming with ease. I took a hiatus from university due to
          financial issues. I began working in the HVAC industry, and soon found myself developing a website for a startup the owner wanted to launch. During my
          time developing, I learned skills such as design, time management, and client relations. The experience opened my mind up to the idea of collaboration
          and working with a team. Though the project never launched, I immediately fell in love with web development and all of the possibilities associated.
          <br><br>  Once my wife and I discovered we were having our son, I decided to enroll in the Thinkful Software Engineering bootcamp to get in the industry. I am very
        excited for the opportunity to work with you, my future client! </p>
